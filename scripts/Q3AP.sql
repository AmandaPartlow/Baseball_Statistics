/*Q3. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. 
Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total 
salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order 
by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?*/

--Tried this first. Yielded only 15 results when it should have yielded 24. Also, the salaries
--were different than in my second attempt. Don't know why on either front.

--This method yields the correct number of players. Salary is different than in the first method.
--I think this one is probably the winner, but I want to understand what went wrong in the first
