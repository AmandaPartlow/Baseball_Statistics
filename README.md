### Nashville Software School Project - SQL Baseball Statistics Analysis

For this project, we used a database of dozens of relational tables created by [Sean Lahman](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). It was my task to answer the following two questions:  

* Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?
* Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 (where average attendance is defined as total attendance divided by number of games). Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.
